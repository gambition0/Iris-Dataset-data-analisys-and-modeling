# Iris-Dataset-data-analisys-and-modeling
This project implements Multinomial Logistic Regression to classify iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) using the Iris dataset. The model is trained and evaluated with Scikit-learn, achieving high accuracy. The repository includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training, evaluation metrics, and visualizations.
Tech Stack: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
Key Features:
✔️ Data preprocessing & feature selection
✔️ Multiclass classification using Logistic Regression (Softmax Regression)
✔️ Performance evaluation with accuracy metrics
✔️ Well-structured Jupyter Notebook
